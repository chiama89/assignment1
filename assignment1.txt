                     My HNi7 Experience So Far

First of all, I want to say thank you so much to HNi7 organisers, this is like a dream come through for me.

I cannot even explain how happy I was to receive the application success mail from you.

It has been ages since I got a success mail and this is just an indication that this career path is made in heaven.

On logging in and being in the various platforms, I am amazed at the level of professionalism, guidiance and help we have received so far.

I pray that God rewards all your efforts.

Thank you for this oppportunity once again.
